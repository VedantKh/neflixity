# Movie Search API

Next.js app with a Flask-based API that handles movie descriptions as vector embeddings to allow the user to do semantic search.
Inherits from [Suflix repo](https://github.com/VedantKh/suflix), made a new github repo since I refactored the codebase into client and server to accommodate for a Flask backend.
